In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the use of prophylactic VA-ECMO support during high-risk PCI can improve outcomes for inoperable patients. The study found that PCI can be successfully performed with adequate hemodynamic support from the ECMO system, and major adverse cardiac events such as cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest can be avoided. Despite the potential risk of complications from the PCI procedure and ECMO system, patients who are good candidates for this type of mechanical revascularization seem to have long-term clinical benefit at 3 years.

However, the selection of patients who truly need mechanical circulatory support during coronary procedures for which conventional PCI could trigger hemodynamic instability remains a challenge. The definition of high-risk PCI still lacks a consensus, and further studies are needed to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic VA-ECMO support.

Moreover, the use of VA-ECMO during high-risk PCI should be approached with caution and only by experienced teams with appropriate resources and facilities. The potential complications associated with the procedure, such as limb ischemia, femoral perforation, and hematoma, should be carefully monitored and managed.

Overall, this study adds to the growing body of literature on the use of ECMO support during high-risk PCI and highlights the potential benefits and challenges associated with this approach.
